Interactive Semiconductor Physics Simulator
This project allows users to explore key semiconductor physics concepts interactively through a web interface. It supports calculations and visualizations for:

- Fermi levels in intrinsic and doped semiconductors
- Carrier concentration and Boltzmann transport
- Drude conductivity and mean free path
- Phonon scattering vs temperature
- Kronig-Penney potential for band structure analysis
- 3D lattice and reciprocal lattice visualization
- Electron diffraction simulations in 3D lattices

Ideal for students, educators, and researchers in semiconductor physics, condensed matter physics, and materials science.
